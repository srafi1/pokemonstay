# Pokemon Stay

Pokemon Go in Google Maps. Run around in the map instead of in real life to catch pokemon.

The current version is up [here](https://pokemonstay.shakilrafi.com). It's not complete, but the core of the game is there.

## Inspiration

Originally created as [Pokemon Gogle](https://github.com/RuvinshteynM/blubberduck), a final project for the class Software Development at Stuyvesant High School.
